    <p>I've disliked Apple for a long time now.</p>
<p>It seems to me like their stance on security, privacy, and environmental impact is more of a marketing tactic than any genuine concern. Their efforts to stomp out right-to-repair is insidious and unforgivable. Whatever impact they saved by not including phone charging cables is heavily outweighed by the amount of devices that have been discarded due to being deliberately unrepairable.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2022) - <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/21/apple-studio-displays-power-cable-is-removable-but-it-requires-a-special-tool/">Apple Studio Display's power cable is not user-removable; and the special tool needed to remove it is only available to Apple technicians.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also I don't really like macOS, but that's mostly just my opinion. <em>However</em>, there are some <em>genuine</em> privacy concerns with the OS, such as that time Apple <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">silently started sending hashes of every program that ran to their servers</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and iCloud has some infamously weak-sauce security, including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">bending to the FBI's will and not encrypting iCloud backups</a>. Because it seems they'll only stand up to the FBI when it happens to generate good PR, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute">FBI-Apple iPhone encryption dispute</a>.</p>

    <p>My day job is being an Site Reliability Engineer. That requires really good obervability (o11y) tooling. I've used Datadog for a year and a half at the time of this writing and it's been disappointing.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs are outrageous.</li>
<li>Their pricing model is wack and makes figuring out where the costs are coming from very difficult.
<ul>
<li>in fairness they've made some recent improvements but they are opt-in via your account rep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom metrics pricing is <em>especially</em> bad. (seriously, why does it <em>have</em> to have an aggregation? What if I just want to see all of the time series??)</li>
<li>Metrics explorer has terrible UX coming from a Prometheus background.</li>
<li>Log search is extremely frustrating because full text search only works on the message field and not other fields in a structured log message.</li>
<li>Monitor management UX is also bad. (why is the query some custom query language that's different from the metrics explorer?)</li>
<li>I personally have had a not-great experience with their support. Friendly, but not super helpful.</li>

    <p>Previously (circa 2018-2019) I had issues with counterfeit products coming from Newegg.</p>
<p>Newegg was also seemingly involved in 2021's <a href="#gigabyte">Gigabyte exploding PSU scandal</a> by dumping seemingly old or RMA stock on unsuspecting customers.</p>
<p>In 2022, Newegg was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL-eB_Bv5Ik">the subject of Tech Jesus's ire</a> when they sold damaged goods and (at first) didn't want to correct the problem.</p>
