I've disliked Apple for a long time now.

It seems to me like their stance on security, privacy, and environmental impact is more of a marketing tactic than any genuine concern. Their efforts to stomp out right-to-repair is insidious and unforgivable. Whatever impact they saved by not including phone charging cables is heavily outweighed by the amount of devices that have been discarded due to being deliberately unrepairable.

- (2022) - [Apple Studio Display's power cable is not user-removable; and the special tool needed to remove it is only available to Apple technicians.](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/21/apple-studio-displays-power-cable-is-removable-but-it-requires-a-special-tool/)

Also I don't really like macOS, but that's mostly just my opinion. _However_, there are some _genuine_ privacy concerns with the OS, such as that time Apple [silently started sending hashes of every program that ran to their servers](https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/).

Oh and iCloud has some infamously weak-sauce security, including [bending to the FBI's will and not encrypting iCloud backups](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT). Because it seems they'll only stand up to the FBI when it happens to generate good PR, such as the [FBI-Apple iPhone encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute).
