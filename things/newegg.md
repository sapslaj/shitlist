Previously (circa 2018-2019) I had issues with counterfeit products coming from Newegg.

Newegg was also seemingly involved in 2021's [Gigabyte exploding PSU scandal](#gigabyte) by dumping seemingly old or RMA stock on unsuspecting customers.

In 2022, Newegg was also [the subject of Tech Jesus's ire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL-eB_Bv5Ik) when they sold damaged goods and (at first) didn't want to correct the problem.
