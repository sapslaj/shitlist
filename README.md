# shitlist

My shit list of things I don't like. More or less a playground for playing around with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) though. Currently hosted via GitHub Pages at [https://sapslaj.github.io/shitlist/](https://sapslaj.github.io/shitlist/).

## Building and Running

Run `npm install` then `npm start` to start a dev server or `npm run build` to build the site into the `_site/` subdirectory.

## Adding things to the list

Add a `.md` file in `things` with some front matter and an elaboration on why that thing is bad.
